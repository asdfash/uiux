# UI

## Week 1

UI is a system that helps user communicate w the system

1. what the system looks like  
2. how the system accepts input from the user
3. how the system responds to user input
4. how the system outputs the results of processing

GUI < UI, UI includes things like keyboards ect.

Something can be objectively better, but if your users don't want to change to it, it'll not work.

- e.g. DOVRAK vs QUERTY

UID < HCI

UI design is an iterative process

1. User Analysis
2. System Prototyping
3. Interface Evaluation

when well designed, the interface almost disappears

But designers have difficulty thinking like users - we can't unlearn something
